= Owl

Owl is a simple command-line work tracker.

== Use

Start working on a task:
----
$ owl start
----
Stop working on that task:
----
$ owl stop
----
This will bring up an editor where you can fill in labels that describe the
task. The labels can be anything; we suggest one-word descriptions of
companies, projects or similar. To get a report of work done since the
beginning of the month, run:
----
$ owl report
----
See the program help and manual for more commands and options.

== Data

Owl keeps track of your time in a SQLite database that lives on your computer.
You control your data, and can create any reports Owl doesn't yet know to do.
